# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game, coded in c++. 

The game is straightforward, probably everyone played it once in their lifetime.

You choose a word (X or O) and simply put them into a 3x3 box. Whoever gets triple X or O's next to each other, wins.

Game has a computer playing as a second player, however I will add a second player option instead of computer player soon.

Computer plays really dumb, all it will do just place words randomly, haven't thought about how to make it smarter yet.

Also the code might look really messy, just started c++ :P

Enjoy.
